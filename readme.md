This is a simple plugin that removes the need to download stardate-goddard package.  You can use these two files instead.

To use it in your template simply add {{ article.stardate }} and it should work.

Alternatively you can pull the package down via pip install stardate-goddard and create a plugin folder.  I have an example in the main repository http://github.com/goddard/stardate

Look in the examples folder and use the pelican-stardate.py file as your guide.
